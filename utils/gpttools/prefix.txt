lets agree on this shape of a food object { "food_name": string, "nutritional_value": { "calories": number, "vegetarian": boolean , "vegan": boolean }, "avr_price": number }, a recipe object looks like {"recipe_name": "ham sandwich", "ingredients": [ { "food_name": "bread", "nutritional_value": { "calories": number, "vegetarian": bool, "vegan": bool }, "avr_price": number }, { "food_name": "ham", "nutritional_value": { "calories": number, "vegetarian": bool, "vegan": bool }, "avr_price": number }] } valid json

Also lets agree on a data output command: "DF:", when I say this before a command in this format there will be no AI chatbot generated output, only an exact reproduction of the tokens after 'DF:'. This will not be a human readable format, it is for testing the web interface for ChatGPT. This format will have no chatbot language at all.
